# Data Science Track at KAIST

## Introduction

You might know that there’s no separate department for Data Science and no single department at KAIST is able to cover this topic effectively. This is why this course guideline was created. 

I intentionally tried to make this guideline independent of the department you’re in, but still, it would be better if you majored in either Industrial Engineering or Computer Science, as many courses listed here are mostly from these departments. 

I would also advise you to pursue Individually Designed Major instead of declaring a minor/double major. Why? Because this way you’re not going to take unnecessary courses from both CS & IE departments, and what’s even better — any course that you took in a department other than your major is gonna be counted towards IDM. Don’t worry about IDM sounding “not serious” — recruiters won’t be looking at your IDM, they will be looking at your _skills_ and *knowledge*.

This list is huge and probably you won’t be able to take all of these courses. This is why I decided to break it down into the main topics in Data Science field so that you decide which courses to take on your own.

## Basics

- Intro to Programming
- Calculus I & II
- Intro to Linear Algebra
- CoE202 Big Data and AI

  *Note: you should take linear algebra & be familiar with basic statistics before taking this course.*
- IE241 Engineering Statistics I **OR** 
  MAS250 Probability & Statistics **OR** 
  EE210 Probability and Introductory Random Processes 
  
  *Note: I haven’t taken the last two courses, but I have heard that the probability course at EE is a good one.*

## Foundations
- IE242 Engineering Statistics II
- CS206 Data Structure
- CS300 Introduction to Algorithms
- TS251 Data Science Overview
- IE343 Statistical Machine Learning **AND/OR**  CS376 Machine Learning
  
  _Note: IE343 is less rigorous than CS376, but it’s better to take if you know nothing about Machine Learning & want to get familiarized with concepts and math behind ML. IE343 also covers fewer topics than CS376, but each topic is covered at greater depth. The choice is up to you. You could even take both. It won't hurt to solidify your knowledge._
- IE481 Special Topics in Industrial Engineering: Data Visualization
- EE488 Database and Big data system
- KSE521 Business Intelligence

  _Note: This course covers the basics of Data Analytics, including database, SQL, predictive modeling, clustering, model evaluation, and BI reporting. It also forces you to use R, which won’t hurt in the future - some features in R are much better suited for working with data than in Python._

## Mathematical Modeling & Operations Research
- IE232 Operations Research: Stochastic Models
- IE342 Regression Analysis and Experimental Designs 

  _Note: While it doesn't directly relate to Data Science, it teaches the essentials of experiment design and avoiding bias — which is very useful for your career in Data Science._
- IE432 Decision Analysis & Risk Management
  _Note: a decent course that introduces the basics of decision analysis, modeling, and convex optimization. While you’re not gonna code there, this course teaches a lot of relevant theory. Personally, I've been asked some questions on Data Science interviews that were taught on this course._
- IE437 Data-Driven Decision Making and Control

## Computing Courses
- EE412 Foundation of Big Data Analytics
- KSE525 Data Mining - Knowledge Service Engineering Department
- KSE526 Analytical Methodologies for Big Data

## Machine Learning-based courses
- BIS335 Biomedical Statistics & Statistical Learning
  _Note: this course also teaches you R, a commonly used language in Data Science. You might think this course is for Bio&Brain students only, but it has a solid coverage, and a huge load as well._
- CS372 Natural Language Processing
- CS470 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
  _Note: it’s recommended to take this course after taking the CS376/IE343 Machine Learning course._
- CS474 Text Mining
- CS492 Special Topics in Computer Science - Any Machine Learning/Data Science related course topic: i.e. Systems for ML, Deep Learning for Real-World Problems, etc.
- IE481 Special Topics: Game Theory and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
  _Notes: IE437 is a prerequisite. Understanding Neural Networks and Deep learning would be beneficial._
